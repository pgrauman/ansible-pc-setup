# Dotfiles
The purpose of this repo is to manage the provisioning of a new computer with my dotfiles and configurations via Ansible. It is not easily configurable for others.

The intention is to be able to setup either a linux or mac workstation. With the ability to distintuish between a local and a remote machine; the latter not needing any GUI applications and shell customizations

# Dependencies
* python3
* ansible
* ssh access to remote
* (optional) vagrant for testing

# Usage
``` bash
# edit inventory if there are more/different hosts then just local

ansible-playbook -i inventory  main.yml --ask-become-pass
``` 

# References
There is a lot of good (better) resources out there by other on Ansible Galaxy and github for many of these tasks. Here I have reimplemented many of these more extensible packages as a medium to lean Ansible syntax.
