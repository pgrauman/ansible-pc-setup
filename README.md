# Dotfiles
The purpose of this repo is to manage the provisioning of a new computer with my dotfiles and configurations via Ansible. It is not easily configurable for others.

The intention is to be able to setup either a linux or mac workstation. With the ability to distintuish between a local and a remote machine; the latter not needing any GUI applications and shell customizations

There is a lot of good (better) resources out there by other on Ansible Galaxy and github for many of these tasks. Here I have reimplemented many of these more extensible packages as a medium to lean Ansible syntax.
